After 15 years working as a purchaser for a medical company, I decided on a career change and took to programming. Based near Brussels - Belgium and a father of two, I now work as a **freelance front-end developer** with a focus on **React** <a href="url"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60004408/230451000-efed6423-9477-4a9d-b6ed-54eb868aa887.png" align="center" height="40" width="40"></a> and am enjoying every minute of it. I continuously strive to grow my skills and look forward to tackling new challenges.
