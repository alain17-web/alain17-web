Welcome to my Github page !

After 15 years working as a purchaser for a medical company, I decided on a career change and took to programming. Based near Brussels - Belgium and a father of two, I have started working as a freelance front-end developer with a focus on React and am enjoying every minute of it. I continuously strive to grow my skills and look forward to tackling new challenges. Feel free to check out my projects and get in touch with me on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alainroos/)
